          <p>"I was as EMT for many years before i joined bootcamp. I´ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people ho had amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredbily fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 eeks as the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course; I´ve successfully sitched careers, orking as a Software Engineer as a VR startup."</p>

          <h4>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h4>
          <p>"Before joining in bootcamp, I´ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next leveç in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I´ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offer. 100% recommende!"</p>
